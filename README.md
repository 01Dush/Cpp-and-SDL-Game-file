I made a C++ and SDL gameplay inspired by Cursor Custodian by Polymars and LIMBO by Arnt Jensen. 

It is an endless platformer gamestyle, you use your cursor to guide the player. The player moves away from your cursor and will jump if you click the left mouse button.

For programming the game and to run it I installed [Mingw64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z/download), [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), [SDL_TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/), and [SDL_Mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
